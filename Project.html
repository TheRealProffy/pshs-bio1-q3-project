					Introduction to the Immune System
				</div>
				
				<div class="section-body">
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						Much like any other branches of science, the study of the immune
						system—or <b>immunology</b>—is constantly changing and a work in
						progress. As generations pass, the process of evolution continues
						to happen in the immune system, increasing the resistance against
						pathogens that enter in our body.
					</div>
					
					<div  class="section-paragraph">
						When we refer to the immune system, we usually relate it to protection
						of the body against diseases. To expound on that idea, the immune
						system protects our body from invasive objects, or <b>pathogens</b>,
						such as viruses and bacteria. More importantly, this system has the
						ability to identify "local" (or from our body) tissues from foreign
						tissues. Once some pathogen enters our body, an attack is commenced
						by the immune system to combat it.
					</div>
					
					<div  class="section-paragraph">
						<b>Note:</b> As you go through the site, you can toggle the background
						by clicking or tapping on the section. Hopefully, this gives easier
						emphasis and readability on what you are currently reading. Thanks, 
						stay healthy!
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div id="functions" class="system-section" onclick="toggleLock(this)">
				<div class="section-header" onmousedown="return false">
					How This System Functions
				</div>
				
				<div class="section-body">
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						A pathogen can enter in our body by contact to an infected person or 
						object or through inhalation. Some are even transmitted by insects
						especially mosquitoes. 
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						To prevent invasion of pathogens in the first place, the barriers of
						the body known as <b>nonspecific defenses</b> block them from entering.
						In the event that the pathogens do enter the body, the immune system 
						initiates an <b>inflammatory rsponse</b>, which causes redness, 
						swelling, or some burning sensation on the site where a foreign object
						entered your body or where an insect bit. When these pathogens
						got to circulate within the body, then the whole body may react by
						inducing fever.
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						Then, to prevent most of the pathogens from causing abnormalities in
						the body or simply to <b>become resistant</b> against these, the
						immune system goes through many and long processes. However, these
						processes provide long-term benefits to the body since the body
						knows how to deal with specific pathogens. The <b>memory cells</b>
						are the ones responsible for this phenomenon. See
						<span class="slideshow" onclick="openSlider()">this
						slider</span> for the processes involved.
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						With the specific defenses, the body learns to deal with the pathogens
						before we get to feel the effects and the sickness. This is the
						reason why <b>vaccination</b> is very helpful to prevent being
						exposed to the full-blown disease. Vaccination is the exposure
						of our body to a part of a pathogen that really doesn't harm our
						body. By being exposed to even some of the pathogen, our body is "fooled"
						to stimulate the immune response as if the pathogen really existed.
						In this way, our body knows how to defend against these pathogens
						when the actual ones do enter our body.
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div id="tips" class="system-section" onclick="toggleLock(this)">
				<div class="section-header" onmousedown="return false">
					Keeping the System Strong
				</div>
				
				<div class="section-body">
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						While the scientific link of lifestyle leading to a stronger immune function
						is in question, maintaining a <b>healthy lifestyle</b> may still prove
						helpful in protecting our body against pathogens!
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						As you may have heard, the intake of <b>Vitamin C</b> is very beneficial in
						boosting your immunity by helping your body to produce white blood cells to
						fight off infection. <b>Citrus fruits</b>, like oranges and lemons, as well
						as <b>vegetables</b> such as spinaches and gingers, are foods rich in Vitamin
						C. Intake of <b>Vitamin E</b> is also important as it is a powerful antioxidant.
						<b>Antioxidants</b> removes damaging oxidizing agents which may play a role
						in diseases, one of which is cancer. It can be found in nuts and spinaches.
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						<b>Sleeping</b> is also very, very important in protecting your body against 
						illnesses. During sleep, your body produces <b>cytokines</b>, which are proteins 
						and may induce fatigue to promote sleep, to fight infection. With lack of sleep,
						antibodies that defend against infections are reduced, leading to sickness.
						Lack of sleep is also linked to increased risk of obesity and diabetes.
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						Lastly, to prevent infection, always maintain a good and <b>proper hygiene</b>.
						Always wash your hands thoroughly especially after you touch your phone or after 
						going to the bathroom.

					Facts and Trivia
				</div>
				
				<div class="section-body">
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						Vaccination came from the Latin word <b>vacca</b>, which means cow.
						Cowpox virus was used to prevent smallpox, which back then was widespread
						and fatal.
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						Before vaccination, there was <b>variolation</b>, which came from
						the Variola virus that caused smallpox.
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						<b>Humorism</b> was the basis of contracting a disease before Louis Pasteur 
						initially proved the Germ Theory. In this belief, an excess or lack of
						"humor" or liquid substance—which included the blood, yellow bile, black bile, 
						and	phlegm—caused impairments and illnesses.
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						<b>Laughter</b> decreases the stress hormones in your body. This, in turn,
						increases immunity and resistance against illnesses.
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						There are chances that your immune system will attack even the tissues in the
						body. When these happens, a person has an <b>autoimmune disorder</b>.
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-paragraph">
						While a moderate amount of exercises is very healthy and beneficial to your
						body, a very high amount may lead to muscle damage and increased risk to
						illness.
